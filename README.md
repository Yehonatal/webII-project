    - `username`
    - `password` (hashed)
    - `email`
    - `role` (to distinguish between sellers and buyers)
    - `user_image_url`
    - `contact_number`

2. **Sellers:**

    - `seller_id` (Primary Key, Foreign Key referencing Users)
    - `company_name` (if applicable)
    - `contact_number`

3. **Buyers:**

    - `buyer_id` (Primary Key, Foreign Key referencing Users)
    - `full_name`
    - `contact_number`

4. **Products:**

    - `product_id` (Primary Key)
    - `seller_id` (Foreign Key referencing Sellers)
    - `name`
    - `description`
    - `price`
    - `status` (e.g., available, sold)
    - `product_type`

5. **Bids:**

    - `bid_id` (Primary Key)
    - `buyer_id` (Foreign Key referencing Buyers)
    - `product_id` (Foreign Key referencing Products)
    - `amount`

#### Relationships Between the Tables:

-   **Users to Sellers/Buyers:** One-to-One relationship using the `user_id` as a foreign key.
-   **Sellers to Products:** One-to-Many relationship using the `seller_id` as a foreign key.
-   **Products to Bids:** One-to-Many relationship using the `product_id` as a foreign key.
-   **Sellers to Contracts:** One-to-Many relationship using the `seller_id` as a foreign key.
-   **Buyers to Bids:** One-to-Many relationship using the `buyer_id` as a foreign key.
